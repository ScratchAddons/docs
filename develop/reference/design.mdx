## Icons

We use [Unicons](https://iconscout.com/unicons) by IconScout. See them on [IconScout's website](https://iconscout.com/unicons/explore/line) or on [Iconify](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/uil/). Please only use icons from this set unless you have explicit permission to use another set. When adding an icon, download it to `/images/icons/iconname.svg`.

## Colors

Our color theme is orange <ColorChip color="#ff7b26"/> and white <ColorChip color="#fff"/>. These colors make up the top bar on our webpages, as well as some other elements.

For our (default) dark theme, our main colors are <ColorChip color="#2a2a2a"/>, <ColorChip color="#222"/>, and <ColorChip color="#000"/>.

For our light theme, our main colors are <ColorChip color="#f0f0f0"/>, <ColorChip color="#aaa"/>, and <ColorChip color="#ddd"/>.

There are of course many other colors we use around our pages, but these colors are most common.

## Logo

This is the logo of the project.
